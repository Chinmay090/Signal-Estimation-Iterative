# Signal-Estimation-Iterative
This is a group project in the Signal Processing course on the topic of Iterative Estimation of Sinusoidal Signal Parameters

This project deals in the estimation of signal parameters. The method used here is to continuously update the initial estimated parameters of the input signal until the correct values have been obtined, within a small margin of error.

The codes in this repo implement this algorithm for 3 signals. One for a signal with a single frequency component, one for a signal with multiple frequencies, and one for a signal where added noise has been introduced beforehand.
